## Welcome to my homepage!
I'm a Ph.D. candidate under the supervison of Dr. Francesca Arici. My research interests are mainly about the operator algebras and related topics. 

In the upcoming semester, we will be running a [seminar] (https://sherlock3711.github.io/Groupoids/) on Groupoid C*-algebras.
